Gainesville-temperature.csv

This file contains daily temperature data for the city of Gainesville for the first half year (6 months) of 2018 and 2017

The columns in the dataset are in the table below.

Column header | Description
--------------|------------
Date | The date information
High_2018 | Daily high temperature of the date in 2018
Low_2018 | Daily low temperature of the date in 2018
High_2017 | Daily high temperature of the date in 2017
Low_2017 | Daily low temperature of the date in 2017


For this dataset, I want to compare the daily high and low temperature for the same date in year 2017 and 2018 to see whether there is a climate change.
I will break down the data into two tables for high temperature comparison data and low temperature comparison.

1st Table - High_temperature_comparison:
This table will provide the the comparison of daily high temperature between year 2017 and 2018.
Date (integer) primary key
High_2017 (float)
High_2018 (float)


2nd Table - Low_temperature_comparison:
This table will provide the the comparison of daily low temperature between year 2017 and 2018.
Date (integer) foreign key
Low_2017 (float)
Low_2018 (float)


Primary key: DAte
Date is unique for the first table, which are the year numbers from 1900 to 2017.

Foreign key: Date
Date is also unique for the second table and is also shared between both tables.
