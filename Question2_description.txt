I want to break down the data into two tables for annual rainfall data and monthly raifnall data.

1st Table - Annual_rainfall:
This table will provide annual rainfall data and the associated year number.
Year (integer) primary key
Annual (float)

2nd Table - Monthly_rainfall:
This table will provide the monthly rainfall data for 12 months and the associated year.
Year (integer) foreign key
Jan (float)
Feb (float)
Mar (float)
Apr (float)
May (float)
Jun (float)
Jul (float)
Aug (float)
Sep (float)
Oct (float)
Nov (float)
Dec (float)

Primary key: Year
Year is unique for the first table, which are the year numbers from 1900 to 2017.

Foreign key: Year
Year is unique for the second table and is also shared between both tables.
